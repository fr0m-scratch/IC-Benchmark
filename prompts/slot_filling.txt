Given the tool schema and the current partially filled object, produce exactly one slot update:
{"slot":"<json-pointer-like-path>", "value": <json-value>}

Rules:
- Fill required fields first.
- Respect enums, formats, numeric ranges, cross-field constraints noted by the validator feedback.
- Do not change other fields.
